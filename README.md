# django-cv-maker
A simple form that takes the data through a POST request and using the django-template-engine, injects the data into a template using tags.


Steps for SET-UP:

1. use command - 
  pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Create a super-user

3. Create a CV template object:  with tenplate name = template1.html 

4. You can add more designs tothe project, they will be listed and will be ready to use automatically.

5. I was also plannig to add a HTML Builder in the end but I keep procrastinating, so I thought i should just push the code and move on.

Thanks!
